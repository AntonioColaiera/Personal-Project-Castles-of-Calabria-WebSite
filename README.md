# Personal-Project-Castles-of-Calabria-WebSite
This REACT Web site uses CRUD operations to fetch information from a MySQL DB through SPRING BOOT.

I created my first website with React, based on some castles in Calabria.
I placed the castles on a matte with leaf and connected it via an API to a Mysql database. Operations are retrieved via CRUD operations created via Spring Boot.

Now I will dedicate myself to more complex projects.
